A simple junk project for review of code snippets.  This project was orginally started to run snippets the page https://www.slingacademy.com/article/introduction-to-concurrency-in-rust-understanding-the-basics/ but then other content was added.
Pushing this to github so I don't lose it when I rebuild my junk workstation.
